Linux scheduling
Advantage:
1. This schedule won't cause starvation.
2. Every process has a chance to run for some time, depending on their priority.
3. If a process doesn't use up its quantum in an epoch, it may get more quantum in the next epoch as a compensation.
4. Easy to implement.

Disadvantage:
1. Process with low priority may only run for a short time and waits for a long time to run again if there are large amount of processes, that means the epoch will become vary long.

=================================

Multi queue scheduling
Advantage:
1. Avoid starvation.
2. For some certain process, we can create it as a real process, it has more chances to run.
3. For normal processes, every process has a chance to run.

Disadvantage:
1. Normal process with high priority may not have a higher chance to run compare to real process.
2. Real processes don't use priority to determine which run first.
3. Hard to implement.
4. Too complicated, include a lot of if condition, may take a long time to do the scheduling.

=================================

Original XINU scheduling
Advantage:
1. Simple and easy.
2. Processes with higher priority always have more chance to run.

Disvantage:
1. Starvation may happen.
2. Processes with low priority have little chance to run.
